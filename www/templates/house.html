        <strong>Ask the officer to slip the warrant under the door or hold it up to the window so you can inspect it.</strong> A search warrant allows police to enter the address listed on the warrant, but officers can only search the areas and for the items listed. An arrest warrant allows police to enter the home of the person listed on the warrant if they believe the person is inside. A warrant of removal/deportation (ICE warrant) does not allow officers to enter a home without consent.

        Even if officers have a warrant, <strong>you have the right to remain silent.</strong> If you choose to speak to the officers, <strong>step outside and close the door.</strong>
